#Â i-MSCP InstantSSH plugin v3.2.0

Plugin which provides full or restricted shell.

## Introduction

This plugin allows to give your customers a full or restricted shell.

A customer to which SSH permissions are given can create SSH users and use them to login on the server.

For each customer, you can set the maximum number of allowed SSH users and choose if they can override the default
authentication options. The authentication options are those specified in the documentation of the authorized_keys file.

## Requirements

* i-MSCP version >= 1.2.3
* openSSH server with both, passsword and key-based authentication support enabled

**Note:** If you want allow only the key-based authentication, you can set the **passwordless_authentication**
configuration option to **TRUE** in the plugin configuration file.

### Debian / Ubuntu packages

* bash
* binstats
* build-essential
* busybox-static or busybox
* flex
* libpam-chroot
* psmisc
* python
* strace

You can install these packages by executing the following commands:

```shell
# aptitude update && aptitude install bash build-essential busybox-static flex libpam-chroot psmisc python strace
```

**Notes**

* If a package is not installed on your system, the plugin installer will throw an error
* If you have any problem with the PAM chroot module read the **Troubleshooting** section below

## Installation

1. Be sure that all requirements as stated in the requirements section are meets
2. Upload the plugin through the plugin management interface
3. Install the plugin through the plugin management interface

**Note:** Depending on your system, installation can take up to several minutes. Time is needed to build jail.

## Update

1. Be sure that all requirements as stated in the requirements section are meets
2. Backup your plugin configuration file if needed
3. Upload the plugin archive through the plugin management interface
4. Restore your plugin configuration file if needed ( compare it with the new version first )
5. Update the plugin list through the plugin management interface

**Note:** Prior any update attempt, do not forget to read the [update_errata.md](update_errata.md) file.

## Configuration

### Authentication options

Default authentication options are set as follow:

```
no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding
```

which in order:

* Forbids authentication agent forwarding
* Forbids TCP forwarding
* Forbids X11 forwarding

You can override default authentication options by editing the **default_ssh_auth_options** option which is defined in
the plugin configuration file. In that file, you can also restrict the list of authentication options that your
customers can add by editing the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option. You must note that any authentication option
appearing in the the default authentication string must also be specified in the **allowed_ssh_auth_options** option.

### Jailed shells

The jailed shells allow you to provide SSH access to your customers in a restricted environment from which they can
theoretically not escape. It's the preferable way to give an SSH access to an un-trusted customer.

Several commands can be added into the jails by simply adding the required application sections to the **app_sections**
configuration option.

The default configuration comes with a set of preselected application sections which allow to setup very restricted
jailed shell environments.

Be aware that the creation of the jailed environments may take time, depending on many factors such as the type of your
server, the number of file to copy inside the jails and so on...

See [Configuration file](../InstantSSH/config.php) for further details.

**Note:** When changing a configuration parameter in the plugin configuration file, do not forget to trigger plugin
change by updating the plugin list through the plugin management interface.

## Troubleshootings

### PAM chroot module

The **PAM chroot** module shipped with some libpam-chroot package versions doesn't work as expected. For instance, You
can see the following logs in the /var/log/auth.log file:

```
...
Oct 13 21:04:31 lucid sshd[1509]: PAM unable to dlopen(/lib/security/pam_chroot.so): /lib/security/pam_chroot.so: undefined symbol: __stack_chk_fail_local
Oct 13 21:04:31 lucid sshd[1509]: PAM adding faulty module: /lib/security/pam_chroot.so
...
```

You can fix this easily by following this procedure:

```shell
# cd /usr/local/src
# mkdir libpam-chroot
# cd libpam-chroot
# apt-get install build-essential debhelper libpam0g-dev
# apt-get source libpam-chroot
# cd libpam-chroot*
```

Edit the **Makefile** file to replace the line:

```
CFLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -Wall -Werror -pedantic
```

by

```
CFLAGS=-fPIC -O2 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -fno-stack-protector
```

Rebuild and reinstall the package as follow:

```bash
# dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us
# cd ..
# dpkg -i libpam-chroot*.deb
```
